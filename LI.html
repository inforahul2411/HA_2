<h1 style="color:red;text-align:center;"><u color:red>LEARNING INTEREST</u></h1>
<P style="color:white;font-size:150%;">During my highschool studies,I was inclined towards Mathematics and logic.Initially, i had less interest towards computer but I was later on interested in computer.So,for pursuing all this at a single institute ,I saw JEE as a pathway and
and I started preparing for it.Then, I qualified JEE with a good rank and was able to get admitted to IIT ROORKEE.NOW,here I am able to have my pursue course related to my interest. I found myself bit interested towards Artificial intelligence and though I am not pro at coding,still I am interestes in it and learning it.
I still have a lot to go and I will be more specified towards my interest.</p>
